### ISLR in Python

This page contains all the pyhton code I wrote when I started to learn Machine Learning from *"An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani.* It specifically contains the following - 
- Labs within the chapter in Python
- Applied exercises at the end of the chapter in Pyhton
