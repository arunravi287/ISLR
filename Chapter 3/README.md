### Chapter 3 - Linear Regression

Statistical learning theory deals with the problem of finding a predictive function based on data. This function has input variables called predictors or features, and output variables called responses. This chapter explores the following major topics:
1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Residual Sum of Squares
3. Null Hypothesis Testing
4. Residual Standard Error, R<sup>2</sup> statistic and F statistic
5. Qualitative predictors in Linear Regression
6. Interaction terms in Linear Regression
7. Non-Linear terms in Linear Regression
8. Problems with Linear Regression
<ul>
      <li>Non-linearity of data</li>
      <li>Correlation of error terms</li>
      <li>Non-constant variance of error terms</li>
      <li>Outliers</li>
      <li>High Leverage point</li>
</ul>
9. Linear Regression vs KNN Regressor
