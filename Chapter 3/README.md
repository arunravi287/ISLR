### Chapter 3 - Linear Regression

Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression. This chapter explores the following major topics:
<ol>
<li>Simple Linear Regression</li>
<li>Residual Sum of Squares</li>
<li>Null Hypothesis Testing</li>
<li>Residual Standard Error, R<sup>2</sup> statistic and F statistic</li>
<li>Qualitative predictors in Linear Regression</li>
<li>Interaction terms in Linear Regression</li>
<li>Non-Linear terms in Linear Regression</li>
<li>Linear Regression vs KNN Regressor</li>
<li>Problems with Linear Regression</li>
<ul>
      <li>Non-linearity of data</li>
      <li>Correlation of error terms</li>
      <li>Non-constant variance of error terms</li>
      <li>Outliers</li>
      <li>High Leverage point</li>
</ul>
</ol>
