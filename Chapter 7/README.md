### Chapter 7 - Moving Beyond Linearity

Non-linear models generally consists of a non linear predictor space. Non-linearity in the model can be brought about using many methods like polynomial regression, smoothing splines, and generalized additive models. This chapter explores the following major topics:
1. Polynomial Regression
2. Step Functions
3. Basis Functions
4. Regression Splines
5. Piecewise Polynomials
6. Spline Basis Representation
7. Smoothing Splines
8. Local Regression (Locally Weighted Regression)
9. Generalized Additive Models
