### Chapter 8 - Tree-Based Methods

Tree-based methods for regression and classification involves stratifying the predictor space into a number of simpler regions. The splitting of the predictor space involves many conditional rules which can be naturally represented using trees. This chapter explores the following major topics:
1. Decision Trees for Regression
2. Recursive Binary Splitting
3. Tree Pruning
4. Decision Trees for Classification
5. Classification Error Metrics
6. Bagging
7. Random Forests
8. Boosting
