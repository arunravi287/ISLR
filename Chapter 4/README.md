### Chapter 4 - Classification

Classification is the process of identifying which class an observation belongs to. Methods used for classification first predict the probability of each of the categories of a qualitative variable as the basis of making the classification. This chapter explores the following major topics:
1. Why not Linear Regression?
2. Logistic Regression
3. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
4. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
5. Bayes Classifier vs LDA
6. Bayes Classifier vs QDA
7. Logistic Regression vs LDA vs QDA vs KNN
