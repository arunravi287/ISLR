### Chapter 2 - Statistical Learning

Statistical learning theory deals with the problem of finding a predictive function based on data. This function has input variables called predictors or features, and output variables called responses. Say we have predictors $$ X = (x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{p}) $$  and a response $$ Y $$ given by:

$$ \normalsize {Y} = f(X) + \epsilon $$

where $$ f$$ is an unknown function and $$ \epsilon$$ is a random error term that is independent of $$ {X} $$ and has a mean of zero. Now Statistical Learning is the process of approximating $$ f $$ such that it resembles the actual relationship between $$ X $$ and $$ Y $$ as closely as possible.
