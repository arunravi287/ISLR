### Chapter 2 - Statistical Learning

Statistical learning theory deals with the problem of finding a predictive function based on data. This function has input variables called predictors or features, and output variables called responses. This chapter explores the following major topics:
1. Why is Statistical Learning Important?
2. Parametric methods vs Non-parametric methods
3. Model flexibility vs Model Interpretability
4. Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning
5. Regression vs Classification
6. Measuing model accuracy
7. Bias-Variance Trade-Off
8. Bayes Classifier vs KNN Classifier
