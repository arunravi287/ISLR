### Chapter 2 - Statistical Learning

Statistical learning theory deals with the problem of finding a predictive function based on data. This function has input variables called predictors or features, and output variables called responses. This chapter explores the following major topics:
1. Why is Statistical Learning important?
2. Parametric Methods vs Non-parametric Methods
3. Model Flexibility vs Model Interpretability
4. Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning
5. Regression vs Classification
6. Measuring model accuracy
7. Bias-Variance Trade-Off
8. Bayes Classifier vs KNN Classifier
